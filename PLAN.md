## ‚ö†Ô∏è **COST MANAGEMENT & FREE TIER GUIDANCE**

### üÜì **FREE TIER SERVICES (Safe to Use)**
- **S3**: 5GB storage, 20,000 GET requests, 2,000 PUT requests/month
- **CloudFront**: 1TB data transfer, 10,000,000 HTTP requests/month
- **Lambda**: 1M requests, 400,000 GB-seconds compute/month
- **API Gateway**: 1M API calls/month
- **DynamoDB**: 25GB storage, 25 RCU, 25 WCU/month
- **Cognito**: 50,000 MAU (Monthly Active Users)
- **SNS**: 1M requests/month
- **Step Functions**: 4,000 state transitions/month
- **CloudWatch**: 10 custom metrics, 5GB log ingestion/month
- **X-Ray**: 100,000 traces/month
- **CodeBuild**: 100 build minutes/month
- **CodePipeline**: 1 active pipeline/month
- **SQS**: 1M requests/month
- **EventBridge**: 1M events/month
- **Secrets Manager**: 30 days free trial, then $0.40/secret/month

4. **API Gateway**: Throttling, usage plans, stages, request/response transformations
5. **IAM**: Policies, roles, policy evaluation logic
6. **Elastic Beanstalk**: Deployment strategies (study theory - not practical)

### **Medium Priority**
7. **CloudFormation**: Templates, stacks, parameters, outputs
8. **CodePipeline/CodeBuild/CodeDeploy**: CI/CD workflows
9. **ECS/Fargate/ECR**: Container services
10. **EventBridge**: Event-driven architecture
