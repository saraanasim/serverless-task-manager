# üõ†Ô∏è AWS Task Approval System - Implementation Guide

This document contains the exact steps taken to implement each phase of the project, along with verification procedures.

---

## ‚úÖ Phase 0: Setup

### **Implementation Steps**

1. **Installed AWS CLI**
   - Downloaded and installed AWS CLI
   - Verified installation: `aws --version`

2. **Installed AWS CDK**
   - Ran: `npm install -g aws-cdk`
   - Verified installation: `cdk --version`

3. **Installed pnpm**
   - Ran: `npm install -g pnpm`
   - Verified installation: `pnpm --version`

4. **Created Monorepo Structure**
   - Created project root directory: `aws-task-approval-system/`
   - Created subdirectories:
     - `infra/` - CDK infrastructure code
     - `backend/` - Lambda functions
     - `frontend/` - React application

5. **Initialized Git Repository**
   - Ran: `git init`
   - Created `.gitignore` files for root and subprojects
   - Created `.gitattributes` file
   - Committed initial structure
   - Pushed to GitHub

6. **Configured AWS CLI**
   - Ran: `aws configure`
   - Entered AWS credentials (Access Key ID, Secret Access Key)
   - Set default region: `us-east-1`
   - Set default output format: `json`

7. **Bootstrapped CDK**
   - Ran: `cdk bootstrap aws://ACCOUNT-ID/us-east-1`
   - **What it does**: Creates a CloudFormation stack that CDK uses to store assets (Lambda code, Docker images, etc.)
   - **Why needed**: CDK requires an S3 bucket and roles to deploy infrastructure

### **Verification Steps**

‚úÖ **Verify AWS CLI**
```bash
aws --version
aws sts get-caller-identity
```
Expected output: Your AWS account details

‚úÖ **Verify CDK**
```bash
cdk --version
```
Expected output: CDK version number

‚úÖ **Verify pnpm**
```bash
pnpm --version
```
Expected output: pnpm version number

‚úÖ **Verify Project Structure**
```bash
ls -la
```
Expected: `infra/`, `backend/`, `frontend/` directories

‚úÖ **Verify CDK Bootstrap**
```bash
aws cloudformation describe-stacks --stack-name CDKToolkit
```
Expected: Stack status "CREATE_COMPLETE"

---

## ‚úÖ Phase 1: Frontend Hosting (S3 + CloudFront)

### **Implementation Steps**

#### **1. Created React Application**

- Navigated to `frontend/` directory
- Ran: `pnpm create vite@latest . --template react-ts`
- **What it does**: Creates a React app with TypeScript using Vite build tool
- **Why Vite**: Faster build times and modern development experience compared to Create React App
- Installed dependencies: `pnpm install`

#### **2. Built Frontend for Production**

- Ran: `pnpm build` in `frontend/` directory
- **What it does**: Compiles TypeScript, bundles React code, optimizes assets
- **Output**: Creates `frontend/dist/` directory with:
  - `index.html` - Main HTML file
  - `assets/` - Bundled JavaScript and CSS files
  - `vite.svg` - Static assets
- **Why needed**: CDK will deploy these built files to S3

#### **3. Created CDK Infrastructure Stack**

**File: `infra/lib/infra-stack.ts`**

**Step 3a: Created Origin Access Identity (OAI)**
- Added `OriginAccessIdentity` construct
- **What it is**: A special CloudFront user that can access S3
- **Why needed**: Allows CloudFront to read from a private S3 bucket
- **Security benefit**: Bucket stays private; only CloudFront can access it

**Step 3b: Created S3 Bucket**
- Created `websiteBucket` with properties:
  - `publicReadAccess: false` - Bucket is private (not publicly accessible)
  - `removalPolicy: DESTROY` - Bucket will be deleted when stack is destroyed
  - `autoDeleteObjects: true` - Objects are deleted before bucket deletion
- **Important**: Did NOT set `websiteIndexDocument` property
  - **Why**: This property creates an S3 website endpoint which doesn't work with OAI
  - **Correct approach**: Use S3 bucket endpoint (not website endpoint) for CloudFront

**Step 3c: Granted CloudFront Access to S3**
- Called `websiteBucket.grantRead(originAccessIdentity)`
- **What it does**: Creates an S3 bucket policy allowing OAI to read objects
- **IAM concept**: Resource-based policy (attached to bucket) allowing specific principal (OAI)

**Step 3d: Created CloudFront Distribution**
- Created `Distribution` construct with:
  - `origin`: S3Origin pointing to websiteBucket with OAI
  - `defaultRootObject: "index.html"` - Default page when accessing root URL
- **What CloudFront does**:
  - CDN (Content Delivery Network) that caches content globally
  - Serves content from edge locations closest to users
  - Reduces latency and improves performance
- **Why CloudFront**: Makes website fast worldwide, even though S3 bucket is in one region

**Step 3e: Created Bucket Deployment**
- Created `BucketDeployment` construct with:
  - `sources`: Points to `../frontend/dist` directory
  - `destinationBucket`: websiteBucket
  - `distribution`: CloudFront distribution
  - `distributionPaths: ['/*']` - Invalidates all cached files
- **What it does**:
  - Automatically uploads files from `frontend/dist/` to S3 bucket
  - Invalidates CloudFront cache so new content is served immediately
  - Runs during `cdk deploy` command
- **Why useful**: Combines build and deployment in one step

**Step 3f: Created Outputs**
- Added `BucketName` output - Shows S3 bucket name
- Added `CloudFrontURL` output - Shows CloudFront domain
- **Why useful**: Easy access to URLs for testing and debugging

#### **4. Deployed Infrastructure**

- Navigated to `infra/` directory
- Ran: `pnpm install` - Installed CDK dependencies
- Ran: `cdk deploy` - Deployed stack to AWS
- **What happens during deploy**:
  1. CDK synthesizes CloudFormation template
  2. Creates S3 bucket
  3. Creates CloudFront distribution
  4. Uploads website files from `frontend/dist/` to S3
  5. Invalidates CloudFront cache
- **Time taken**: 10-15 minutes (mostly CloudFront distribution creation)

#### **5. Waited for CloudFront Propagation**

- CloudFront distribution takes 10-15 minutes to fully deploy
- Status changes from "In Progress" to "Deployed"
- **Why it takes time**: CloudFront updates edge locations globally (400+ locations)

### **Key Concepts Learned**

#### **1. S3 Bucket Configuration**
- **Private bucket**: Not directly accessible from internet (secure by default)
- **Removal policies**: Controls what happens to resources during stack deletion
- **Auto-delete objects**: Ensures clean deletion (otherwise bucket deletion fails if not empty)

#### **2. CloudFront Origin Access Identity (OAI)**
- **Purpose**: Allows CloudFront to access private S3 bucket
- **Security model**: S3 bucket policy grants read permission only to OAI
- **Benefit**: Users access content through CloudFront, not directly from S3
- **Exam importance**: Understanding OAI is crucial for AWS Developer Associate

#### **3. S3 Bucket Endpoint vs Website Endpoint**
- **Bucket endpoint** (e.g., `bucket.s3.amazonaws.com`):
  - Used for private buckets with CloudFront
  - Works with OAI
  - More secure
- **Website endpoint** (e.g., `bucket.s3-website-region.amazonaws.com`):
  - Used for public static websites
  - Requires public bucket
  - Does NOT work with OAI
  - Created when `websiteIndexDocument` property is set
- **Our choice**: Bucket endpoint for security with CloudFront

#### **4. CloudFront Distribution**
- **CDN (Content Delivery Network)**: Caches content at edge locations worldwide
- **Edge locations**: Over 400 globally distributed servers
- **Benefits**:
  - Reduced latency (content served from nearest location)
  - Reduced load on origin (S3)
  - DDoS protection
  - HTTPS support
- **Cache invalidation**: Necessary when deploying updates to clear old cached content

#### **5. CDK Bucket Deployment**
- **Automation**: Combines multiple steps (build, upload, invalidate) into one
- **Under the hood**: Creates a Lambda function that runs during deployment
- **Trade-off**: Adds deployment time but simplifies process

#### **6. Infrastructure as Code (CDK)**
- **Declarative**: You describe what you want, CDK creates it
- **Type-safe**: TypeScript catches errors before deployment
- **Reusable**: Easy to recreate infrastructure or deploy to multiple environments
- **Version control**: Infrastructure changes tracked in Git

### **Verification Steps**

#### **‚úÖ Verify Frontend Build**

```bash
cd frontend
ls -la dist/
```

**Expected output:**
- `index.html` file
- `assets/` directory
- `vite.svg` file

**What you're checking:** Production build was successful

#### **‚úÖ Verify CDK Deployment**

```bash
cd infra
cdk outputs
```

**Expected output:**
```
InfraStack.BucketName = infrastack-websitebucket-xxxxx
InfraStack.CloudFrontURL = dxxxxx.cloudfront.net
```

**What you're checking:** Stack deployed successfully and resources were created

#### **‚úÖ Verify S3 Bucket (AWS CLI)**

```bash
# List all S3 buckets
aws s3 ls

# List contents of your bucket (replace with actual bucket name)
aws s3 ls s3://infrastack-websitebucket-xxxxx/
```

**Expected output:**
- `index.html`
- `assets/` directory
- `vite.svg`

**What you're checking:** Files were uploaded to S3

#### **‚úÖ Verify S3 Bucket (AWS Console)**

1. Go to [AWS S3 Console](https://s3.console.aws.amazon.com/)
2. Find bucket starting with `infrastack-websitebucket`
3. Click on bucket name
4. **Verify files exist**: `index.html`, `assets/`, `vite.svg`
5. Click **Permissions** tab
6. Click **Bucket Policy**
   - **Check**: Policy exists granting CloudFront OAI read access
   - **What to look for**: `"Principal": {"AWS": "arn:aws:iam::cloudfront:user/..."}"`
7. Check **Block public access** settings
   - **Expected**: All checkboxes should be ON (bucket is not public)

**What you're checking:** 
- Files deployed correctly
- Security configured properly (private bucket with OAI access)

#### **‚úÖ Verify CloudFront Distribution (AWS Console)**

1. Go to [AWS CloudFront Console](https://console.aws.amazon.com/cloudfront/)
2. Find your distribution
3. Click on Distribution ID
4. **General** tab:
   - **Status**: Should be "Deployed" (not "In Progress")
   - **Domain Name**: Should match CDK output
5. Click **Origins** tab:
   - **Origin Domain**: Should be `xxx.s3.amazonaws.com` (bucket endpoint, NOT website endpoint)
   - **Origin Type**: Should show "S3"
   - **Origin Access**: Should show "Origin Access Control" or "Legacy Access Identities"
6. Click **Behaviors** tab:
   - **Default behavior**: Should exist and point to S3 origin
   - **Viewer Protocol Policy**: Typically "Redirect HTTP to HTTPS"

**What you're checking:**
- CloudFront is fully deployed
- Correctly configured to use S3 bucket endpoint
- OAI is properly set up
- Security settings are correct

#### **‚úÖ Verify Website Works**

**Test with CLI:**
```bash
# Test CloudFront URL (replace with your actual URL)
curl -I https://dxxxxx.cloudfront.net/
```

**Expected output:**
- `HTTP/2 200` or `HTTP 200 OK`
- Header: `content-type: text/html`
- Header: `x-cache: Miss from cloudfront` (first request) or `Hit from cloudfront` (subsequent requests)

**Test in Browser:**
1. Open CloudFront URL in browser
2. **Expected**: React Vite default page loads
3. **Expected**: React logo visible and spinning
4. **No errors**: No 403, 404, or other errors

**What you're checking:**
- Website is publicly accessible through CloudFront
- Content is being served correctly
- No permission errors

#### **‚úÖ Verify CloudFront Caching**

```bash
# First request (should miss cache)
curl -I https://dxxxxx.cloudfront.net/

# Second request (should hit cache)
curl -I https://dxxxxx.cloudfront.net/
```

**Headers to check:**
- `X-Cache: Miss from cloudfront` (first request) ‚Üí Content fetched from S3
- `X-Cache: Hit from cloudfront` (second request) ‚Üí Content served from cache
- `X-Amz-Cf-Id: xxx` ‚Üí CloudFront request ID

**What you're checking:** CloudFront is caching content properly

#### **‚úÖ Common Issues and Solutions**

**Issue**: 403 Forbidden error
- **Possible causes:**
  - CloudFront can't access S3 bucket
  - OAI not configured correctly
  - Bucket policy missing or incorrect
  - Using S3 website endpoint instead of bucket endpoint
- **Solution:**
  - Verify OAI exists in CDK code
  - Verify `grantRead()` is called
  - Check bucket policy in S3 console
  - Ensure `websiteIndexDocument` is NOT set in bucket config

**Issue**: 404 Not Found
- **Possible causes:**
  - Files not deployed to S3
  - Wrong path in CloudFront
  - `defaultRootObject` not set
- **Solution:**
  - Check S3 bucket contents
  - Verify `frontend/dist/` has files before deployment
  - Redeploy with `cdk deploy`

**Issue**: Old content showing after update
- **Possible cause:** CloudFront cache not invalidated
- **Solution:**
  - Wait a few minutes (TTL expiry)
  - Verify `distributionPaths: ['/*']` is set in BucketDeployment
  - Manually invalidate cache in CloudFront console
  - Hard refresh browser (Ctrl+Shift+R or Cmd+Shift+R)

**Issue**: "Status: In Progress" for long time
- **Normal behavior:** CloudFront takes 10-15 minutes to deploy
- **What to do:** Wait patiently, check back later

### **Cost Analysis**

‚úÖ **Phase 1 is FREE TIER eligible**

**S3 Free Tier:**
- 5GB storage
- 20,000 GET requests/month
- 2,000 PUT requests/month

**CloudFront Free Tier:**
- 1TB data transfer out/month
- 10,000,000 HTTP/HTTPS requests/month

## ‚úÖ Phase 1.5: Infrastructure Structure Refactoring

### **What Was Done**

Refactored the monolithic CDK stack into a modular structure following industry standards and Single Responsibility Principle.

### **Implementation Steps**

#### **1. Created Environment Configuration**

**File Created: `infra/config/environments.ts`**

- **What**: Created centralized configuration for different environments (dev/prod)
- **Why**: Avoid hardcoding values, easy to deploy to multiple environments
- **How**: 
  - Defined `EnvironmentConfig` TypeScript interface
  - Created `devConfig` with dev settings
  - Created `prodConfig` with prod settings
- **Contains**:
  - Region configuration
  - Frontend build path
  - Naming conventions (prefix + suffix)
  - Resource tags

#### **2. Created S3 Bucket Construct**

**File Created: `infra/lib/constructs/s3-bucket-construct.ts`**

- **What**: Reusable construct that creates S3 buckets
- **Why**: Can be reused for website hosting, file storage, logs, etc.
- **How**: Single-purpose class that only handles S3 bucket creation
- **Free tier optimizations**:
  - `versioned: false` - No versioning to avoid extra storage costs
  - `encryption: S3_MANAGED` - Free SSE-S3 encryption
  - `removalPolicy: DESTROY` - Easy cleanup
  - `autoDeleteObjects: true` - Automatic cleanup on destroy

#### **3. Created CloudFront Distribution Construct**

**File Created: `infra/lib/constructs/cloudfront-distribution-construct.ts`**

- **What**: Reusable construct that creates CloudFront distributions
- **Why**: Can be reused with different origins (S3, ALB, custom origins)
- **How**: Single-purpose class that handles CloudFront + OAI setup
- **Free tier optimizations**:
  - `priceClass: PRICE_CLASS_100` - Uses only US, Canada, Europe (cheapest option)
  - `cachePolicy: CACHING_OPTIMIZED` - Reduces origin requests
  - Includes Origin Access Identity (OAI) creation and configuration

#### **4. Created S3 Deployment Construct**

**File Created: `infra/lib/constructs/s3-deployment-construct.ts`**

- **What**: Reusable construct that deploys files to S3
- **Why**: Can be reused to deploy any files to any bucket
- **How**: Single-purpose class that handles file deployment and CloudFront invalidation
- **Free tier note**: First 1,000 CloudFront invalidation paths/month are free

#### **5. Created Frontend Stack**

**File Created: `infra/lib/stacks/frontend-stack.ts`**

- **What**: Stack that composes the three constructs above
- **Why**: Separation of concerns - stack orchestrates, constructs implement
- **How**: 
  1. Creates S3 bucket using `S3BucketConstruct`
  2. Creates CloudFront distribution using `CloudFrontDistributionConstruct`
  3. Deploys files using `S3DeploymentConstruct`
- **Benefits**:
  - Environment-aware (uses config)
  - Properly tagged
  - Clean outputs
  - Exports for other stacks

#### **6. Updated App Entry Point**

**File Updated: `infra/bin/infra.ts`**

- **What**: Updated to use new `FrontendStack` instead of monolithic `InfraStack`
- **Why**: Clean separation between app orchestration and stack implementation
- **How**:
  - Imports environment config
  - Selects dev/prod based on context
  - Creates stack with appropriate naming
- **Stack naming**: `TaskApproval-Frontend-Dev` (follows naming convention)

#### **7. Backed Up Old Stack**

**File Renamed: `infra/lib/infra-stack.ts` ‚Üí `infra/lib/infra-stack.ts.backup`**

- **What**: Kept old monolithic stack as reference
- **Why**: Prevents conflicts, allows rollback if needed

### **Key Concepts Learned**

#### **Single Responsibility Principle**
- Each construct does ONE thing:
  - `S3BucketConstruct` ‚Üí Creates S3 bucket
  - `CloudFrontDistributionConstruct` ‚Üí Creates CloudFront + OAI
  - `S3DeploymentConstruct` ‚Üí Deploys files
- **Benefits**: Easier to understand, test, reuse, and maintain

#### **Composition Over Inheritance**
- Stack composes multiple focused constructs
- Constructs can be mixed and matched
- No tight coupling between components

#### **Configuration Management**
- Centralized environment settings
- Type-safe configuration (TypeScript interfaces)
- Easy to add new environments (staging, qa, etc.)

#### **Construct Library Pattern**
- Reusable building blocks
- Consistent configuration across uses
- Industry-standard CDK organization

### **Architecture Comparison**

**Before (Monolithic):**
```
infra-stack.ts (one big file)
‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ All S3, CloudFront, deployment logic mixed together
```

**After (Modular):**
```
config/environments.ts (configuration)
lib/constructs/ (reusable building blocks)
  ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ s3-bucket-construct.ts
  ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ cloudfront-distribution-construct.ts
  ‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ s3-deployment-construct.ts
lib/stacks/ (deployment units)
  ‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ frontend-stack.ts (composes constructs)
bin/infra.ts (app orchestration)
```

### **Verification Steps**

#### **‚úÖ No Infrastructure Changes**

This was a refactoring, so infrastructure should be identical:

```bash
cd infra
cdk diff
```

**Expected**: No changes or only cosmetic differences (stack names, comments)

#### **‚úÖ Build Succeeds**

```bash
cd infra
pnpm build
```

**Expected**: TypeScript compiles without errors

#### **‚úÖ Deployment Works**

```bash
cd infra
cdk deploy
```

**Expected**:
- Stack name changes to `TaskApproval-Frontend-Dev`
- All resources remain functionally the same
- Website continues to work

#### **‚úÖ Website Still Works**

```bash
cdk outputs
# Test CloudFront URL in browser
```

**Expected**: React app loads correctly (same as before refactoring)

### **Free Tier Impact**

‚úÖ **Phase 1.5 has NO additional costs**

- Refactoring is code organization only
- Same AWS resources as Phase 1
- Same S3 and CloudFront usage
- **Cost**: $0 (same as Phase 1)

### **Benefits Achieved**

1. **Better Organization**: Clear file structure with single-purpose files
2. **Reusability**: Constructs can be used in future phases
3. **Maintainability**: Changes are localized to specific constructs
4. **Scalability**: Easy to add new constructs and stacks
5. **Industry Standard**: Follows AWS CDK best practices

### **Cleanup**

Same as Phase 1:

```bash
cd infra
cdk destroy
```

All resources deleted regardless of structure (monolithic or modular).
